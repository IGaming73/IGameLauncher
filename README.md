How to use:

- Launching a game: Simply click on the big "Play" button.
- Modifying a game: Click on the big banner/image of the game, and the settings will show up. You can modify what you want or create a desktop shortcut, and then click "Apply" to apply the changes. Clicking "Cancel" will not apply any change (including adding a shortcut).
